Jabberwocky
Lewis Carroll

'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves 
  Did gyre and gimble in the wabe: 

All mimsy were the borogoves, 
  And the mome raths outgrabe. 
  
"Beware the Jabberwock, my son! 
    The jaws that bite, the claws that catch! 
Bewa re the Jubjub bird, and shun 
  The frumious Bandersnatch!" 

He took his vorpal sword in hand; 
  Long time the manxome foe he sought-- 
So re sted he by the Tumtum tree 
  And  stood awhile in thought. 
 
And, as in uffish thought he stood, 
   The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame, 
Ca me whiffling through the tulgey wood, 
  And burbled as it came! 
 
O ne, two! One, two! And through and through 
   The vorpal blade went snicker-snack! 
He left it dead, and with its head 
  H e went galumphing back. 

"AnD hast thou slain the Jabberwock? 
  Come to my arms, my beamish boy! 
O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!" 
  He chortled in his joy. 

'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves 
  Did gyre and gimble in the wabe: 
All mimsy were the borogoves, 
  and the mome raths outgrabe.
